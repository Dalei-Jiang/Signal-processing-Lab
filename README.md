# Signal-processing-Lab

Here are my works done in the UIUC course ECE311, Signal Processing Lab. In the course ECE310, I have learned the basic concepts, functions and algorithms of signal processing. Such as Introduction to discrete-time systems and discrete-time signal processing with an emphasis on causal systems; discrete-time linear systems, difference equations, z-transforms, discrete convolution, stability, discrete-time Fourier transforms, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, digital filter design, discrete Fourier transforms, fast Fourier transforms, spectral analysis, and applications of digital signal processing.

Associated with the course ECE310, in the lab section, I have done these assignments to better understand the signal processing.
